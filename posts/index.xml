      <description>I spent most of my career writing code - mostly Ruby on Rails and Objective-C, and in the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly in Engineering Management, which means writing less code and managing people and strategy more.
But thanks to extra time and headspace introduced by COVID-19 related #StayHome social distancing and lockdown measures (aka Circuit Breaker if you&amp;rsquo;re in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬), I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to bring myself up to date and rekindle my relationship with writing and deploying code.</description>
