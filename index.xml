      <description>I spent most of my career writing code - mostly Ruby on Rails and Objective-C, and in the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly in Engineering Management, which means writing less code and managing people and strategy more.
But thanks to extra time and headspace introduced by COVID-19 related #StayHome social distancing and lockdown measures (aka Circuit Breaker if you&amp;rsquo;re in 🇸🇬), I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to bring myself up to date and rekindle my relationship with writing and deploying code.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am Jinny Wong (sometimes I also go by my married surname, Lo; other times, I go by my Chinese name, Shū Jǐn) — I&amp;rsquo;m an Engineering Manager/Software Engineer based in the sunny island of Singapore 🇸🇬
I mostly code in Objective-C and Swift, Ruby on Rails, and some (non-React) JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;m also attempting to pick up some Go.
These days, I mostly manage engineers and engineering strategy.
I am also a fountain pen and general writing instruments geek, you may see me occasionally write about pens, paper and ink 🖋</description>
